            <p>GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System)[1] is a fictional artificially superintelligent computer system from the video game series Portal. GLaDOS later appeared in The Lab and Lego Dimensions. The character was created by Erik Wolpaw and Kim Swift and voiced by Ellen McLain. GLaDOS is responsible for testing and maintenance in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center in all titles. While GLaDOS initially appears in the first game to simply be a voice that guides the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. The second game, as well as the Valve-created comic Lab Rat, reveals that she was mistreated by the scientists[2] and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of Portal. She is apparently destroyed at the end of the first game but returns in the sequel, in which she is comically supplanted by her former intelligence dampener and temporarily stuck on a potato battery, while her past as the human Caroline is also explored.

              The inspiration for the character's creation extends from Wolpaw's use of a text-to-speech program while writing lines for the video game Psychonauts. Other game developers working on Psychonauts found the lines funnier as a result of the synthesized voice. GLaDOS was originally intended to be present solely in the first area of Portal; she was well received by other designers and her role was expanded as a result. Play testers were motivated to complete tests in the game due to her guidance. While the game was initially designed with other characters, they were later removed, leaving GLaDOS as the only character players encounter. The physical appearance of GLaDOS went through several designs, one of which featured a large disk below her. McLain imitated dialog read aloud by a speech synthesizer with her own voice, which was then processed to sound more robotic, and performed songs in character during the closing credits of both entries in the series. "Still Alive" became hugely successful, notably appearing in the Rock Band game series, and has been a popular song for YouTube users to cover.
              
              GLaDOS received critical acclaim from critics and gamers alike, some of whom called her narcissistic, passive-aggressive, sinister, and witty. She is considered one of the greatest video game characters, particularly among those created in the 2000s. Universally praised for her contributions to the caliber of Portal's narrative, GLaDOS received multiple awards for being the best new game character in 2007 from GameSpy, GamePro, and X-Play. A number of publications listed her as one of the all-time greatest video game villains, including IGN and Game Informer, both of which ranked her first. She has been the subject of significant critical analysis from both journalists and game developers, who have compared her to other villainous computer systems in fiction, including HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey and SHODAN from System Shock, with GLaDOS meeting the former in Lego Dimensions.
              For much of Portal, GLaDOS serves solely as the narrator, guiding players through the test chambers. Her voice is robotic, but distinctly female. Over time, players learn that she is, in fact, leading the player-character Chell to her death. As Chell escapes her control, GLaDOS's announcements get increasingly personal and farcical. Her personality has been described as passive-aggressive, witty, narcissistic, and sinister. She has several system personality cores installed into her, partly to prevent her from killing anyone. At the climax of the game, Chell enters GLaDOS's chambers, where it is revealed that she's actually a complex artificial intelligence system composed of robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS's voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in competing with the Black Mesa Research Facility on the creation of portal technology.[3] Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line ice inhibitor and disk operating system. GLaDOS is installed to serve as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside several control consoles and an incinerator, the latter being her eventual demise.[4]
  
              Wheatley, a personality core previously attached to GLaDOS at an indeterminate time, is introduced in Portal 2. He is revealed to be an "intelligence dampening sphere", designed to feed her a neverending stream of bad ideas and inhibit her intellectual and emotional development in order to maintain her compliance.[5] Through Wheatley, it's understood by the player that GLaDOS was initially conditioned to perform tests through rewards in the form of euphoric sensations induced by their completion. Over time, however, as she became insensate to the effect, GLaDOS claims she became self-motivated, interested solely in "science".[6] Upon being disconnected from the Aperture Science facility, GLaDOS treats Chell with more civility. The player then learns that GLaDOS's personality was inherited from that of Caroline, the personal assistant of Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson, and is much warmer to Chell when under Caroline's influence.[7]</p>
